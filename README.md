# Cs-340-Project-Two
The required functionality of this project is to allow a user to view a table of data and be able to organize it based on certain filters based on button clicks. For this project MongoDB is used because it is a database with easy to learn commands, it’s also more scalable and provides superior performance to SQL and other relational databases. Connecting to Python is also easy as you just need to use PyMongo. The Dash framework that was used helps to build data visualization interfaces without requiring any advanced knowledge on web applications. There were several challenges with this project. First issue I had right off the bat which was that I wasn’t sure how to fully implement the functions required for this project as I haven’t really learned Python as a language, I also couldn’t get passed the authentication section of the project once it was ran. After getting a lot of help from peer helpers and SNHU tutors I was able to design most of the project. The only problem I have still is that I’m not able to test the functionality of my design, even after attending multiple help sessions I wasn’t able to fix the issue. I even made different aacuser accounts to try and fix the issue but nothing seemed to work.
